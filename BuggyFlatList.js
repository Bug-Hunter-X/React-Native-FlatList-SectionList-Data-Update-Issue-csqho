In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, an unusual error can occur where the component renders seemingly correctly initially, but fails to update when new data is provided via the `data` prop.  This often happens if the `data` prop changes but React's shallow comparison determines that the object reference is the same, preventing a re-render. This is especially tricky to debug because there are no obvious errors. The component looks fine, but it doesn't reflect the updated state.
